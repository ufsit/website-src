Good afternoon, SIT'ers!  

  

Tonight, we're going to have a very relaxed meeting.  

  

We'll start off with a review of our experiences during the latest CTF that we competed in (rwthCTF).  

After that, we're going to screen the movie Hackers ([http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/)).  

  

Pizzas and sodas will be provided.  

Arrive on time if you want a say in what kind we get...  

Or, email me off-list with your request(s)  ;-)
