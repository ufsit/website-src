If you plan to participate in the DEF CON CTF Qualifier this weekend (starts tomorrow at 8:00PM), and you have not yet registered… you MUST be at tonight’s meeting. Registration closes at 8:00PM tonight! If you’ll be participating remotely, you will need to e-mail me with a request for the team hash.

John Sawyer (InGuardians) has graciously set up a collaboration box for us. I will distribute the connection details at tonight’s meeting.

Erik Cabetas (Include Security) will be sponsoring our weekend hackery with 0xBAADF00D (pizza!)

**Location & Time**:
6:00PM
1151 McCarty Hall A
