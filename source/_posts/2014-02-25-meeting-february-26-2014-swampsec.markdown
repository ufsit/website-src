This week, SIT is taking a trip to SwampSec <[http://swampsec.org/](http://swampsec.org/)>! If you don't know what SwampSec is, it's a gathering of infosec professionals that takes place on the last Wednesday (7-9pm) of the month downtown at Stubbies & Steins <[http://stubbiesandsteins.com/](http://stubbiesandsteins.com/)>.







Stubbies is a great place to hang out and there will also be free appetizers provided by the Stubbies' owner! Hope to see you there!
