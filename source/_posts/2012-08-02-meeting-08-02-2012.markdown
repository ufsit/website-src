Good afternoon hackers!

At tonight’s meeting, I’m going to brag about how awesome Las Vegas and DEF CON were last week.
It was my first time, so I was all like “OMG I love you, DEF CON! Let’s be together forever!” or something like that…

I’ve got photos and crazy stories to tell, as well as some neat swag and conference materials (music, presentation files, and other neat stuff that we got in our goodie bag)
…and (of course) the prized DEF CON XX badge -- if anyone has a soldering iron and/or a miniUSB cable, please bring it/them!

Oh… and make sure to bring a flash drive or something if you want files :)
