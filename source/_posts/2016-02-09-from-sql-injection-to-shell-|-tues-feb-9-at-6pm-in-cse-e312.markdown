Hey SITers!

This week, we'll be doing a hands-on exercise called "From SQL Injection to Shell". In this exercise, you'll be using SQL injection with a few other techniques in order to gain remote code execution on the system. We'll be using the NETLAB machines again so feel free to bring your own computer, but you're more than welcome to use the machines in the lab.

<!-- MORE -->
Hope to see you all there!
