Hey SITers!







This week, come to Stubbies & Steins <[http://stubbiesandsteins.com/](http://stubbiesandsteins.com/)> and join us for this month's SwampSec! This will be the last SwampSec at Stubbies as Stubbies will be closing on Saturday.







**Please note that we will NOT be meeting in CSE309.**







If you don't know what SwampSec is, it's a gathering of infosec professionals and enthusiasts that takes place from 7-9pm on the fourth Wednesday of the month. For more information, check out http://swampsec.org/ and follow SwampSec on Twitter @swampsec. Hope to see you there!
