Good morning SIT'ers!

Last week, you got a taste of some pretty basic Recon tactics. We did a
little bit of manual web crawling, domain and IP resolution... and a few
of you found interesting Best Buy locations on farms in Iceland?

Near the end of the meeting, we released a "tool pack" containing the
following tools:
- recon-ng
- pushpin v1 (v2 released this past weekend)
- fierce domain scan
- dnsrecon (blank directory, couldn't provide due to dead link on dev's
site)

So... this week, it's Tool Timeâ„¢!
We're going to show you a short demo of the first two tools. Then, we'll
give you some hands-on time.
