Good evening, SIT'ers!

Tonight's meeting will be very informal.
Discussion will center around the upcoming UCSB iCTF (March 22nd).

I will not be able to attend on-site, due to a nasty head cold I've been
battling since Friday. I *might* be able to participate via Google Hangout.

Mauricio will take over running things tonight.
