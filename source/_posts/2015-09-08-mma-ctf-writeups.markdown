Last weekend, the SIT competed in [MMA CTF](https://uecmma.github.io/mmactf/) and had a few members solve challenges! If you were one of those members, we want your writeup! If you have a writeup for a challenge, please send them to [Andrew](mailto: me+ufsit@andrewjkerr.com) and we will post them below. Thanks!
