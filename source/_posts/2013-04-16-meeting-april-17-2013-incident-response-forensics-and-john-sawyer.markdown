Good morning SITers!










John Sawyer, a SIT founder & pen tester for InGuardians, will be




speaking on Wed night. We will also be holding officer elections as




well as talking about some upcoming events that SIT will be hosting.







John will be covering the following topics to get everyone prepped for




the upcoming SIT CTF on Saturday, April 20:










" ***Incident Response and Forensics***







We will do a quick introduction into the world of incident response




and forensics with a brief overview of what the different stages are,




important tools and techniques, and some hands-on examples. Pay




careful attention because some of these exercises may come in handy




during the SIT CTF.







The example exercises will be available in our GitHub repo so you can




grab them later if you miss the meeting.













***Cyber Quest April 2013***




Packet Capture-based Web Vulnerability Analysis




[http://uscc.cyberquests.org/](http://uscc.cyberquests.org/)







We probably won't cover much about how to do this competition since




Mauricio has already talked about the topic, but I want to discuss it




briefly. It would be awesome to get as many UF participants as we can.
