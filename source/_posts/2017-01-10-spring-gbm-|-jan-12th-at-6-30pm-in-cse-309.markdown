Hey SIT! Do you like free pizza?

Join us for our Spring GBM! We will be looking back and reviewing the Fall semester as well as sharing our plans for the future. This meeting will be a great time to:

- Get acquainted with our officers
- Review what we learned in 2016
- Reminisce about previous club travel experiences
- Learn about our goals and visions for the club

In addition, we will begin taking applications for Chair positions! We aim to have a Corporate Liaison Chair and a CTF chair. Come to the meeting for more details!

*** FREE PIZZA INCLUDED ***
