Hey SITers!







Just because we won't be having regular meetings doesn't mean we won't be doing things. This week, come to Stubbies & Steins <[http://stubbiesandsteins.com/](http://stubbiesandsteins.com/)> and join us for this month's SwampSec!










If you don't know what SwampSec is, it's a gathering of infosec professionals and enthusiasts that takes place from 7-9pm on the fourth Wednesday of the month. For more information, check out [http://swampsec.org/](http://swampsec.org/) and follow SwampSec on Twitter [@swampsec](https://twitter.com/swampsec). Hope to see you there!
