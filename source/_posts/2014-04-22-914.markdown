Come celebrate the end of classes with us this Wednesday at SwampSec <[http://swampsec.org/](http://swampsec.org/)>! If you don't know what SwampSec is, it's a gathering of infosec professionals that (mostly) takes place on the last Wednesday (7-9pm) of the month downtown at Stubbies & Steins <[http://stubbiesandsteins.com/](http://stubbiesandsteins.com/)>. I even hear there will be free appetizers there! :)
