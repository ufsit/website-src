Hello SITers,

This week we will be learning about how the port scanner nmap works by taking a look at some C code and doing some buffer overflow challenges for another prize! If you would like to download the challenges ahead of time you can find them here: [https://github.com/ufsit/overflowchallenges-2-18-2015](https://github.com/ufsit/overflowchallenges-2-18-2015).

Password for gpg will be released at the meeting.

Hope to see you there!
