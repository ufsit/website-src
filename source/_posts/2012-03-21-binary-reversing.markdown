**3/15/12**

We met in the CSE dungeon at 6pm and started at 6:15pm in 1151 McCarty A.

We started with making sure everyone was on the ListServ.

Then Kris gave us an introduction to binary reversing and a helloworld example using gdb and Ida.

Erik Cabetas from Include Security joined us to talk about future opportunities for the club, Capture the Flag Competitions, and about careers in computer security.Â  Also, Include Security sponsored us with pizza!

Next meeting we will work on a binary reversing example provided by Include Security.

We ended saying we would meet in CSE 404 next Thursday at 6:15 with more pizza.
