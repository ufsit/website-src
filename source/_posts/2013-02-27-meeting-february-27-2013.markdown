Good evening, SIT'ers!

Tomorrow night, we're going to discuss yet another CTF topic. This time,
we're going to show you how to sniff and analyze network traffic!
Capture all the things!

In CTFs like the upcoming UCSB iCTF (March 22nd), which have an
attack/defend network component, it is often (read: always) necessary to
capture and parse traffic going across the wire. Are they hacking us?

You might be thinking to yourself... "so, do I need some fancy FBI
wiretapping device and a signal analyzer to do this?" Fear not! You just
need a couple tools, some eyeballs (maybe), and the willingness to stare
at some packet data :-)

As I've said a bazillion times in the past, almost anyone can find
*something* useful when looking at a packet capture. If you enjoy
defending the castle... this is definitely one of the areas you should
consider.


**Shtoof to Bring**
