Hey SITers!

As promised, here are the instructions for signing up for our ListServ:


<blockquote>Email [president@ufsit.org](mailto:president@ufsit.org) with "REQUEST [First] [Last]" in the subject line (i.e. - REQUEST Albert Gator).</blockquote>


And how to fill out an Ethics form for next meeting:


<blockquote>Register for [SIT on GatorConnect](https://ufl.collegiatelink.net/organization/SIT) and the form will be available soon.</blockquote>


Also, check out Kernel Sanders on [CTFTime.org](https://ctftime.org/team/397) as well as try some of [our introductory challenges](http://ufhack.org/challenges/)! We do have an IRC and you can find instructions on how to access it [here](http://ufhack.org/irc/) as well as a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ufsit) where meeting announcements (and photos!) will be posted.

See you all next Wednesday!
