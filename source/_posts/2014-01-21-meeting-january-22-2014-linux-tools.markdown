Hey SITers!







This week we will be taking a look at some of the cool things we can do with our new Ubuntu server installation and start getting comfortable with the command line. Some of the tools we'll be taking a look at are:








	
  * SSH

	
  * Cron jobs

	
  * tmux

	
  * And more!




We'll also be talking a little bit about Ghost in the Shellcode and some of the challenges we solved over the weekend.
