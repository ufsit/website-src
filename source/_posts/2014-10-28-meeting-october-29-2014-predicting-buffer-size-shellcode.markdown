Hey SITers!










This week, we will be familiarizing members with predicting the size of buffers that may have been optimized by using pattern_create.rb and pattern_offset.rb. We'll also be introducing the concept of shellcode along with msfvenom - a useful tool that is part of the metasploit framework.













Make sure to bring your laptop with the VMs that we installed at the beginning of the semester! If you did not get a chance to download them, find an officer and we'll give you them.
