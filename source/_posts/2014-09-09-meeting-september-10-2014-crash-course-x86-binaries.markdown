Hi SITers!

This week, we'll be familiarizing ourselves with x86 binaries on Linux and provide a starting point for reading/modifying machine code. We'll also be learning about the hex editor hte and other tools like ndisasm.

You can view the document for this meeting here: [RED-MOD-0](https://ufhack.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/red-mod-0.pdf) and the doc that goes with it [RED-MOD-0-ANNOTATED-ASSEMBLY](http://ufhack.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/red-mod-0-annotated-assembly.pdf)

Make sure to bring your laptop with the VMs from last meeting installed! If you did not get a chance to download them, find an officer and we'll give you them.

Also, as a quick reminder, you can find the meeting recordings at [https://www.youtube.com/ufsit](https://www.youtube.com/ufsit)!
