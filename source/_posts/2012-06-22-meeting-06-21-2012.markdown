At tonight’s meeting, we’ll be discussing the WordPress Security Scanner. Developed by Ryan Dewhurst (ethicalhack3r), this powerful tool can help penetration testers check the security of WordPress installations, using a black box approach. While it’s _only_ targeted at sites running WordPress (who uses WordPress, right? oh wait…), this scanner is no joke.

Come join us for discussion and demos!
