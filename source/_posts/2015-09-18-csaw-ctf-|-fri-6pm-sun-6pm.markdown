Hey SITers!

Like we mentioned at Tuesday’s meeting, we’ll be competing in CSAW CTF (https://ctf.isis.poly.edu/) this weekend. If you want to come hang out and work on some challenges, we’ll be in CSE E309 starting at:

Friday @ 6pm  
Saturday @ noon  
Sunday @ noon  

<!-- more -->

Can’t make those times? Don’t fret! We’ll be collaborating on the UFSIT IRC (#ufsit on Freenode) and will be posting instructions on how to participate remotely there.

Hope to see you there!

~ Andrew
