This week, SIT is taking a trip to SwampSec <[http://swampsec.org/](http://swampsec.org/)>! If you don't know what SwampSec is, it's a gathering of infosec professionals that takes place on the last Wednesday (7-9pm) of the month downtown at the Bull. <[https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=The+Bull&data=!4m10!1m9!4m8!1m3!1d138502!2d-82.319746!3d29.6862705!3m2!1i1920!2i959!4f13.1](https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=The+Bull&data=!4m10!1m9!4m8!1m3!1d138502!2d-82.319746!3d29.6862705!3m2!1i1920!2i959!4f13.1)>







We'll be there to discuss security topics, CSAW, and, if you're dying to know, the challenge from last week.







We'll be carpooling so if you would like to carpool there, show up at McCarty at **6:45** and we'll all go over together. If you want to take a bus, the 5 runs along University and will drop you off a block away from the Bull.







Please note, **_this meeting is going to take place at the Bull. We are meeting up at McCarty to travel there, but the meeting will be at the Bull_.**







If you have any questions, let us know!
