Hey SITers!

For some meetings and CTFs this semester, you're going to want a Kali Linux VM. To set this up, you'll want to download and install VirtualBox (free, https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) OR use your CISE OnTheHub store account to get VMWare for free (check your CISE email for instructions on activating your account).

Here are the instructions for getting Kali Linux set up in either VMWare or VirtualBox:

<!-- more -->

VirtualBox:

1. Download the 'Kali Linux 64 bit VBox' image from https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vmware-arm-image-download (torrent is recommended!).
2. Extract the .7z file.
3. Double click on the '.ova' file and follow VirtualBox's installation prompt.
4. Launch it!
5. Use 'root' as the username and 'toor' as the password to login.

VMWare:

1. Download the 'Kali Linux 64 bit VM' image from https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vmware-arm-image-download (torrent is recommended!).
2. Extract the .7z file and navigate into the unzipped directory.
3. Double click on the '.vmx' file to open the Virtual Machine! (Note: if you want to move this into a different directory, do that before opening it!)
4. Use 'root' as the username and 'toor' as the password to login.
5. We recommend changing the default 'toor' password to something a bit stronger and less default-y.

If you have any issues, please let us know in #ufsit on Freenode!
