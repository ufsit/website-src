Good evening, SIT'ers!

We had a great time competing in the Ghost in the Shellcode CTF this weekend. Thanks to those who participated.. we truly couldn't have done it without you. Feel free to give a brief account of your experience at this week's meeting :-)

Oh... and all I'm going to say is... have you kissed a girl "before it catches fire"?
Also... this is why we can't have nice things. 

Since we didn't get to it last week, we're starting our section on Binary Reversing this week.

Gabriel is going to teach you about some of the tools needed for reversing, with a short demo... and then we'll have you go hands-on against a couple challenges. If you're a little more advanced, fear not... we _will_ have at least one bonus challenge.
