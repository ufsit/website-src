Good evening, hackers!

As promised, here is the follow-up e-mail to Thursday's SIT meeting.

First order of business... meetings have been moved to MONDAY nights. Same time; same room.

While this week's meeting was more or less administrative, we briefly discussed some of the different types of hacking: specifically Web Stuff and Binary Reversing. We also watched a DEFCON talk, given by Jordan Wiens (aka psifertex), related to Capture The Flag competitions.

At the end of the meeting, we discussed some websites and books that new members may find useful when starting out in security.
