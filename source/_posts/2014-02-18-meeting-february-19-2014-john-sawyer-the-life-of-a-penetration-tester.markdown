Hey SITers!







This week, John Sawyer will be presenting "The Life of a Penetration Tester." John is a Senior Security Analyst with InGuardians and a founder of UFSIT. His work as a security consultant with InGuardians has taken him all across the US and abroad to work with all different types of clients in industries that include oil and gas, financial, medical, educational, government, utilities, insurance, and pretty much anything else you can think of.



John's presentation will include a lots of stories from the trenches, what penetration testers really do, and some of the challenges of the job. There will also be a fun challenge that will highlight how penetration testers and students with CTF experience would solve the problem. Some free books (some signed by authors), shirts, and other things will also be given away.
