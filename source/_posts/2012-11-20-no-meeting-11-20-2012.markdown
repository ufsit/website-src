Good morning, SIT'ers!

While we will not have a formal meeting this week... several of us are going to Demo Night at the Gainesville Hackerspace ([http://skillhouse.org/](http://skillhouse.org/)).

Some very cool demos are in the lineup, including one by SIT co-founder John Sawyer. He's going to showcase the awesome wireless tool, rfcat. I'm told he'll also have some fun hardware with him ^_^

The space is located in the Sun Center Plaza, in the former location of comedy club Wise Guys.
