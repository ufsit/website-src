Hey SITers!











This week, Vincent will be giving an introductory presentation on reverse engineering x86 binaries and we'll also be providing some fun challenges for everyone to solve.







Also, another reminder that B-Sides Orlando is this weekend! We'll be coordinating hotel rooms and car rides at the meeting, so make sure to get your ticket soon.
