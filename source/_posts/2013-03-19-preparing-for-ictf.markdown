As many of you know,  the [UCSB iCTF](http://ictf.cs.ucsb.edu/) takes place on March 22. This time we are changing address and will be running it from the [Gainesville Hackerspace](http://skillhouse.org/) location. There is something to be said about comfy chairs.

Of course, that means moving and setting up our game rig there. And, suddenly, the Stack's gone!

Don't worry; all the contents are fine... specially the Kernel Sanders. I mean, we were there until 2am this morning and have not electrocuted ourselves in the process. But we do have some interior decoration issues we must address.

Which reminds me: don't forget that this Wednesday meeting will take place at hackerspace. We do want to make sure you can find your way there before game day.
