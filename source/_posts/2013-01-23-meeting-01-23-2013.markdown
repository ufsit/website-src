Good morning, SIT'ers!  

  

Tomorrow night, we're going to introduce some of the tools that you will use throughout the semester.  

  

First, we'll walk you through the installation of VirtualBox, then you'll learn how to load up a virtual machine (VM)(we'll be using BackTrack Linux for this).  
  

  

After that, it'll be time to break out a few programs.
