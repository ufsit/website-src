Hey SITers!









This week, we will be going to the first OWASP Gainesville meetup! If you haven't heard of OWASP, OWASP stands for The Open Web Application Security Project and is a worldwide not-for-profit charitable organization focused on improving the security of software.










The meeting will be held from 6:30pm - 8:00pm at the Alachua County District Headquarters 401 E University Ave, Gainesville, FL. For more information, see the Gainesville OWASP page: [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Gainesville](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Gainesville).
