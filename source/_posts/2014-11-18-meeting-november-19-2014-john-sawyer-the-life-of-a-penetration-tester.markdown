This week, John Sawyer will be talking about his work as a security consultant and penetration tester. The talk will include lots of stories from the trenches, what penetration testers really do, and some of the challenges of the job. John's presentation will also include some live demonstrations related to the research from his recent BSidesJax presentation, The Dark Side of the Quantified Self.







John is a Senior Security Analyst with InGuardians and a founder of UFSIT and SwampSec. His work as a security consultant with InGuardians has taken him all across the US and abroad to work with all different types of clients in industries that include oil and gas, financial, medical, educational, government, utilities, insurance, and pretty much anything else you can think of.
