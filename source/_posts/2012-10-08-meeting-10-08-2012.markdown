Good morning, SIT'ers!

Tonight's meeting will center around the Discovery/Recon phase of penetration testing. In this session, we’ll teach you some of the tools and techniques that you can use while performing reconnaissance on your target(s).

Recon is one of the most essential (and often times one of the most time consuming) parts of a penetration test. This is where you really learn about your target(s).

+ Topics we hope to cover:
- Footprinting
- Scanning and Enumeration
- Vulnerability Analysis

**Ethics Agreement**
At this meeting, you will also be required to agree to and sign the Ethics Agreement posted at [http://ufhack.org/ethics/](http://ufhack.org/ethics/)
Please bring a copy of the agreement, printed out and signed, to tonight’s meeting. In the near future, we’ll begin checking to make sure everyone attending has signed off on it.
