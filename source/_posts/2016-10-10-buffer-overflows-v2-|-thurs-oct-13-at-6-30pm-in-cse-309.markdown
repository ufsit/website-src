Hey SIT!

Hopefully everyone had a nice, long weekend, safe from Hurricane Matthew. Best wishes to everyone who has friends and family in the thick of the storm.

Since our Buffer Overflow meeting was cancelled last week, we will be having it this week instead. This is an extremely important and fundamental technique for hackers, so I highly recommend coming out. 

Stay tuned on our facebook and mailing list for a possible CTF this Friday!
