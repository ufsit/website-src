Hey SITers!

This week, we're going to wind down the semester with a panel of some of our awesome graduating seniors to discuss security jobs and internships! We'll be discussing topics such as getting a security position, what a security role entails, and how security is involved in a general developer role as well as any questions you have.

<!-- MORE -->
Hope to see you all there!

~ Andrew
