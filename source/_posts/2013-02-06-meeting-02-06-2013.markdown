Good afternoon, SIT'ers!  

  

Tonight, we'll pick up where we left off two weeks back.  

  

Last time, we showed you how to install VirtualBox and BackTrack.  

This week, it's time to break out the tools! ...and some concepts we can use during CTFs.  

  

Some of the tools will include:  

- SSH  

- grep  

- cat  

- less  

  

You will have the opportunity to go hands-on with all of these tools tonight! This will help you practice and understand how convenient they can be when using a Linux-based system. You'll also get an understanding of how these tools will play a part in the upcoming CTFs.  

  

  

**Stuff to bring**  

- Computer  

- VirtualBox  

- BackTrack Linux
