Hey SITers!

We've got quite a few things going on tomorrow night!

For our main topic, Nick will be demonstrating the Shellshock exploit and talking about how we can use Shellshock to break into unpatched systems. After the short presentation, we'll be giving you all some virtual machines to break into to practice what was taught! If you haven't signed an ethics agreement, please make sure to [sign one](http://ufsit.org/join/) before the meeting tomorrow night.

<!-- MORE -->

And, if that wasn't cool enough, the first ever UF CCDC interest meeting is happening right after SIT! At this meeting, Grant will be going over competition rules, how to play and win, and how we'll be fielding a team of superstar defenders. If you're interested in CCDC at all, please stick around afterwards!

But first, we'll be voting on the constitution changes that were announced at the last meeting. As mentioned, we have a pull request out on GitHub with our proposed changes: https://github.com/ufsit/documents/pull/1. Feel free to review those before coming to the meeting and voting on them.

Hope to see you all there!

~ Andrew
