Hey SITers!

This week, we'll be doing a mini-CTF that some of the admins have put together! We've collected a few challenges of varying difficulty/subjects that we think you all will have some fun completing. For the first part of the meeting, we'll all be working in teams (or individually) and, the second part, we'll have walk throughs of some of the harder challenges.

Make sure to bring a laptop!
