Good afternoon Hackers!

This evening’s meeting is going to be a very special one… and one that I'm sure you'll be highly disappointed if you miss!!!

We are having a little chat with -one- of the qualifying DEF CON CTF Qualifier teams. -First-, I’d like to thank the members of the team for taking time out of their busy schedules to talk us through some of  their solutions. This opportunity is truly -one- in a lifetime.

Ok… enough beating around the bush. Tonight, we have the unique opportunity to sit down with the members of Hates Irony (first-place team in this year’s DEF CON CTF Qualifier). The chat will be over Google Hangout, so you’ll be able to connect remotely if you have a Google account (e-mail me for details).

If you’re able to attend, I highly recommend it! I think you’ll be more than satisfied with the experience :)
