Hey SITers!

This week, we will talk about the basic concepts of computer memory and how it's organized in Linux in order to dive into buffer overflow exploits!

You can view the doc for tonight at: [http://sheepshellcode.com/tutorials/RED-MOD/red-mod-1.pdf](http://sheepshellcode.com/tutorials/RED-MOD/red-mod-1.pdf)

Make sure to bring your laptop with the VMs that we installed at the beginning of the semester! If you did not get a chance to download them, find an officer and we'll give you them.
