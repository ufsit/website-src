Hey SIT!

Think Incognito mode makes you an undetectable ninja on the web? Think again.

This week, we will be learning what it truly takes to stay stealthy and covert in the online world. Join us to discover how to use Proxies, VPNs, and more to ensure that your online excursions are untraceable by Russian hackers, secret government agencies, or nosy neighbors. Come on out to protect your privacy!

Also, be on the lookout for an announcement regarding a CTF this Friday. Exact times TBD, but be prepared!

See ya there!
