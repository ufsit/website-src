Hey SITers!

Welcome back to another year! Hope everyone had a productive and relaxing summer. If you're ready for another semester of Information Security awesomeness, come out to our first meeting tonight! We'll be introducing our new officers, talking you through our vision for the club, and showing off some AWESOME hacking demonstrations.

<!-- MORE -->
If that's not enough, we'll also be providing FREE PIZZA! Hope to see you there!

~ Nick
