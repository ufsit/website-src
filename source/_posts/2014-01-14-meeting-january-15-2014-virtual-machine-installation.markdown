Hey SITers!







This week we will all be installing Ubuntu server in VirtualBox! We will be providing step by step instructions for the installation, so the only things we ask you to bring are:







- Your laptop!







- The Ubuntu server 32-bit image <[http://www.ubuntu.com/start-download?distro=server&bits=32&release=lts](http://www.ubuntu.com/start-download?distro=server&bits=32&release=lts)> (Please note this is a direct download.)







- The latest version of VirtualBox for your OS:




       * Windows: [http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.3.6/VirtualBox-4.3.6-91406-Win.exe](http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.3.6/VirtualBox-4.3.6-91406-Win.exe) (Please note this is a direct download.)




       * OSX: [http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.3.6/VirtualBox-4.3.6-91406-OSX.dmg](http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.3.6/VirtualBox-4.3.6-91406-OSX.dmg) (Please note this is a direct download.)




       * Linux: [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads)







Also, just a reminder to join #ufsit on Freenode and come join the conversation! If you have any questions about the above downloads or just want to discuss infosec in general, the IRC is the best place to do it.







We also now have a new Facebook page located at [https://www.facebook.com/ufsit](https://www.facebook.com/ufsit)! If you have a Facebook, make sure to 'like' us to keep up to date with all that SIT is doing.
