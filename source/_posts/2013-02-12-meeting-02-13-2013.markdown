Good morning, SIT'ers!

This week, we're going to finish up our first lesson on tools, and then get to the challenge from last week.

This time, we shouldn't have any "issues" with the server.

After the challenge, we're going to switch gears, and have a discussion on binary reversing (a big part of the current CTF scene). Gabriel is going to teach you about some of the tools needed for reversing, with a short demo... and then we'll have you go hands-on against a couple challenges. If you're a little more advanced, fear not... we _will_ have at least one bonus challenge.


**Ghost in the Shellcode CTF**
If you missed hearing about this, the GitS CTF is this weekend (Feb 15-17th). UFSIT will be competing in the CTF, under the team name Kernel Sanders.

We will be set up in the 1151 McCarty A conference room, with plenty of CAT5 for local participants. Remote participation will be available, for those who need it. SSH keys will be supplied at this week's SIT meeting.

Food and drinks will be provided for those participating locally.
