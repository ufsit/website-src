Hi SITers!

Tomorrow (Tuesday January 19, 2016) is going to be our first meeting on the spring semester! Our president Greg will be giving you all the rundown on what SIT is and also an introduction to InfoSec as a whole. If you've been looking to get into InfoSec and also meet fellow students who are also into InfoSec, come on out (and bring a friend)!

<!-- MORE -->

Hope to see you all there!

~ Andrew
