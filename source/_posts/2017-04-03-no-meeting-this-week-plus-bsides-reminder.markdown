Hey SIT!


We will not be meeting this Thursday. Instead, use that time to cheer on our CCDC team! They will be representing UFSIT in the Regional CCDC competition in Kennesaw, Georgia starting this Wednesday. If we win, we'll be heading to Nationals! Best of luck to our team!

In other news, remember to sign up for our BSides event this Saturday! We will be carpooling to Orlando and spending the day learning about various topics of Cyber Security. Check out our pinned Facebook post for more information!

Have a great week!
