This week, SIT is taking a trip to SwampSec <[http://swampsec.org/](http://swampsec.org/)>! If you don't know what SwampSec is, it's a gathering of infosec professionals that takes place from 7-9pm on the fourth/last Wednesday of the month downtown at Stubbies & Steins <[http://stubbiesandsteins.com/](http://stubbiesandsteins.com/)>. Hope to see you there!
