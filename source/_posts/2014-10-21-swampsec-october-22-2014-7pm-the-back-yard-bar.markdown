Hey SITers!







This week, come join us at The Back Yard Bar (between Boca Fiesta and the Palomino Pool Hall downtown; map: [http://www.swampsec.org/map-web.png](http://www.swampsec.org/map-web.png)) for this month's SwampSec!







**Please note that we will NOT be meeting in CSE309.**







If you don't know what SwampSec is, it's a gathering of infosec professionals and enthusiasts that takes place from 7 to roughly 9pm on the fourth Wednesday of the month. For more information, check out [http://swampsec.org/](http://swampsec.org/) and follow SwampSec on Twitter @swampsec. Hope to see you there!
