It's been awhile since we've had a CTF event, and this one turned out great! At 6pm on Friday, Feb 3rd, our crack team of hackers met up for a night of hacking and exploitation. Within 4 hours we had solved most of the problems for the AlexCTF! 

However, this CTF is far from over. Keep an eye out for new challenges to be added periodically. While we won't be meeting up in person to collaborate, feel free to discuss challenges on our slack channel. 

Thanks for coming out!
