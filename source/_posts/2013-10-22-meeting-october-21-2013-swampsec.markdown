This week, SIT is taking a trip to SwampSec <[http://swampsec.org/](http://swampsec.org/)>! If you don't know what SwampSec is, it's a gathering of infosec professionals that takes place on the last Wednesday (7-9pm) of the month downtown atÂ Stubbies & Steins <[http://stubbiesandsteins.com/](http://stubbiesandsteins.com/)>







We'll be carpooling so if you would like to carpool there, show up at McCarty at 6:45 and we'll all go over together.







**_Please note, this meeting is going to take place at Stubbies. We are meeting up at McCarty to travel there, but the meeting will be at Stubbies._**







If you have any questions, let us know!
