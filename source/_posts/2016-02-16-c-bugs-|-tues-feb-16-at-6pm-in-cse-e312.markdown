Hey SITers!

This week, our former president Vincent will be giving a talk on C and C bugs! He'll first be going through a tutorial on C followed by some of the more common C bugs as well as fixes and exploits for them.

<!-- MORE -->

Afterwards (around 7:30pm), Grant will be holding a debrief for CCDC. If you're unaware, the team made it to the SECCDC regionals! Grant will be talking about how the team did in the competition, what happened during the preliminaries, and what to expect next at regionals.

Hope to see you all there!

~ Andrew
