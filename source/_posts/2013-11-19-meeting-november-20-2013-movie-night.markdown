Hey SITers!

This Wednesday we will be having more of a social meeting and will be watching WarGames!

WarGames is an older, yet still awesome movie that is about a young man who discovers a back door into a new military computer and decides to play a simple game of "Global Thermonuclear War" that could possibly start World War 3. It's definitely a must see and a good way to unwind before finals.
