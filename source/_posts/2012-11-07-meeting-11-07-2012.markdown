Good afternoon SIT'ers!

At tonight's meeting, we'll cap off the "passive" portion of our Recon series, and then move into active scanning.

We'll start off the discussion with a short presentation and demos of basic dnsrecon usage.
Following that, we'll have a Q&A session and some hands-on time.

For the last half of the meeting, Gabriel will present on basic usage of nmap.
He's also agreed to show us a couple of demos.
