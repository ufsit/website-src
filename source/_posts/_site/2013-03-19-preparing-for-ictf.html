<p>As many of you know,  the <a href="http://ictf.cs.ucsb.edu/">UCSB iCTF</a> takes place on March 22. This time we are changing address and will be running it from the <a href="http://skillhouse.org/">Gainesville Hackerspace</a> location. There is something to be said about comfy chairs.</p>

<p>Of course, that means moving and setting up our game rig there. And, suddenly, the Stack’s gone!</p>

<p>Don’t worry; all the contents are fine… specially the Kernel Sanders. I mean, we were there until 2am this morning and have not electrocuted ourselves in the process. But we do have some interior decoration issues we must address.</p>

<p>Which reminds me: don’t forget that this Wednesday meeting will take place at hackerspace. We do want to make sure you can find your way there before game day.</p>
