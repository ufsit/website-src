<h3 id="decompilers---"><strong>– DECOMPILERS –</strong></h3>

<p>Decompiler takes byte code and turns it into a readable source
We can reverse any interpreted language which includes:
- Python and Java
Why?!
- … to hack Minecraft of course.
- Which, on a side note, it’s pretty easy to decompile Java code
How?!
- JAD (for Java) and UNPY (for Python)</p>

<h3 id="jad---"><strong>– JAD –</strong></h3>

<p>1) Open up Backtrack
2) Backtrack -&gt; Reverse Engineering -&gt; JAD
- Note: It will open up in Terminal
3) Use ./jad [path/of/class/file.class]
- This will output a .jad file which you can use “cat” to display the text or open it in vim</p>

<p><em>Challenges!</em>
- There are challenges on GitHub!
- If you already have the “sitgit” already setup, just navigate to [sitgit-folder]/meeting-files and use “git pull” to pull the new challenges!
- I personally recommend copying them to your desktop for easy access when using JAD!
- Remember that not all challenges are solvable……….</p>

<h3 id="unpy-aka-uncompyle---"><strong>– UNPY (aka uncompyle) –</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>The zip file for UNPY is in the meeting-files folder in [sitgit-folder]!
Installation:
1) Navigate to the unzipped uncompyle-master directory
2) Run “python2.7 setup.py build”
3) Run “python2.7 setup.py install”
1) Navigate to the uncompyle-master directory (or wherever you saved the uncompyle files)
2) Run “python2.7 uncomplyer.py [path/of/class/file.pyc]”
3) The output will be what’s in the [file.pyc]!</li>
</ul>

<p>As always, if you have a question about anything, send an email to our listserv or come chat in the IRC!</p>
