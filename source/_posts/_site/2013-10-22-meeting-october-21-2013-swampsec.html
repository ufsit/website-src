<p>This week, SIT is taking a trip to SwampSec &lt;<a href="http://swampsec.org/">http://swampsec.org/</a>&gt;! If you don’t know what SwampSec is, it’s a gathering of infosec professionals that takes place on the last Wednesday (7-9pm) of the month downtown at Stubbies &amp; Steins &lt;<a href="http://stubbiesandsteins.com/">http://stubbiesandsteins.com/</a>&gt;</p>

<p>We’ll be carpooling so if you would like to carpool there, show up at McCarty at 6:45 and we’ll all go over together.</p>

<p><strong><em>Please note, this meeting is going to take place at Stubbies. We are meeting up at McCarty to travel there, but the meeting will be at Stubbies.</em></strong></p>

<p>If you have any questions, let us know!</p>
