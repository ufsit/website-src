<p>Hey SITers!</p>

<p>In case you didn’t get a chance to grab the virtual machines that we’ll be using this semester, you can download them at <a href="http://pwn.sploitlab.com:32611/">http://pwn.sploitlab.com:32611/</a> or you can find an officer at any of the meetings and we can transfer the files to your computer.</p>

<p>Also, if you’re interested in joining UFSIT, make sure to join the mailing list by sending an email to president@ufsit.org with the subject “MailingList FirstName LastName” and also join UFSIT on GatorConnect <a href="https://ufl.collegiatelink.net/organization/SIT">https://ufl.collegiatelink.net/organization/SIT</a>.</p>
