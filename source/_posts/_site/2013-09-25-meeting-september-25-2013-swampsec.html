<p>This week, SIT is taking a trip to SwampSec &lt;<a href="http://swampsec.org/">http://swampsec.org/</a>&gt;! If you don’t know what SwampSec is, it’s a gathering of infosec professionals that takes place on the last Wednesday (7-9pm) of the month downtown at the Bull. &lt;<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=The+Bull&amp;data=!4m10!1m9!4m8!1m3!1d138502!2d-82.319746!3d29.6862705!3m2!1i1920!2i959!4f13.1">https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=The+Bull&amp;data=!4m10!1m9!4m8!1m3!1d138502!2d-82.319746!3d29.6862705!3m2!1i1920!2i959!4f13.1</a>&gt;</p>

<p>We’ll be there to discuss security topics, CSAW, and, if you’re dying to know, the challenge from last week.</p>

<p>We’ll be carpooling so if you would like to carpool there, show up at McCarty at <strong>6:45</strong> and we’ll all go over together. If you want to take a bus, the 5 runs along University and will drop you off a block away from the Bull.</p>

<p>Please note, <strong><em>this meeting is going to take place at the Bull. We are meeting up at McCarty to travel there, but the meeting will be at the Bull</em>.</strong></p>

<p>If you have any questions, let us know!</p>
