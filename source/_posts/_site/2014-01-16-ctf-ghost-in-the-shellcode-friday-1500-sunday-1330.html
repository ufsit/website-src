<p>SITers,</p>

<p>We’re a little under 24hrs away from the first CTF of the semester - <a href="http://ghostintheshellcode.com/">Ghost in the Shellcode</a> &lt;<a href="http://ghostintheshellcode.com/">http://ghostintheshellcode.com/</a>&gt; - and I hope you all are ready to hack away!</p>

<p>We will be in our regular meeting location (1151 McCarty Hall A) from 3:00pm on Friday until 1:30pm on Sunday so feel free to drop by at any time to have some fun. All you’ll need to help out is yourself and your laptop!</p>

<p>One thing we stress is the fact that, even if you <em>think</em> you don’t have enough knowledge to help out, you actually do. Every person that has come out in the past has been a huge help and has always learned a ton of useful tips/tricks/skills (I know I have.)</p>

<p>If you want to help set up, show up early and, if you have any questions about the CTF, just ask in the irc (freenode, #ufsit.)</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>

<p>Also, make sure to join <a href="https://ufl.collegiatelink.net/organization/SIT/">SIT on GatorConnect</a> &lt;<a href="https://ufl.collegiatelink.net/organization/SIT/">https://ufl.collegiatelink.net/organization/SIT/</a>&gt; if you haven’t already!</p>
