<p>Good morning, SIT’ers!</p>

<p>Tonight’s meeting will center around the Discovery/Recon phase of penetration testing. In this session, we’ll teach you some of the tools and techniques that you can use while performing reconnaissance on your target(s).</p>

<p>Recon is one of the most essential (and often times one of the most time consuming) parts of a penetration test. This is where you really learn about your target(s).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Topics we hope to cover:</li>
  <li>Footprinting</li>
  <li>Scanning and Enumeration</li>
  <li>Vulnerability Analysis</li>
</ul>
