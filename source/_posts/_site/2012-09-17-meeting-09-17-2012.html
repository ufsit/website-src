<p>Good morning, hackers!</p>

<p>At tonight’s meeting, we’ve got a bit of a show for you!</p>

<p>Remember how we talked about Web Exploits and Binary Reversing at the last meeting?
Well, this time… we’re going to /show/ you how it’s done! That’s right, you’re going to get a live demo of each of them. We’ll also go over some of the tools and techniques you can use to accomplish the hacks.</p>

<p>Also… If anyone is available 10-15 minutes prior to the meeting, we could use some help setting up in the conference room. Please let me know via e-mail if you’d be interested in helping out.</p>

<p><strong>Location and time</strong>:
6:00pm - 8:00pm
