<p>Hey SITers!</p>

<p>This week, we will talk about the basic concepts of computer memory and how it’s organized in Linux in order to dive into buffer overflow exploits!</p>

<p>You can view the doc for tonight at: <a href="http://sheepshellcode.com/tutorials/RED-MOD/red-mod-1.pdf">http://sheepshellcode.com/tutorials/RED-MOD/red-mod-1.pdf</a></p>

<p>Make sure to bring your laptop with the VMs that we installed at the beginning of the semester! If you did not get a chance to download them, find an officer and we’ll give you them.</p>
