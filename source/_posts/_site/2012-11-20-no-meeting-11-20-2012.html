<p>Good morning, SIT’ers!</p>

<p>While we will not have a formal meeting this week… several of us are going to Demo Night at the Gainesville Hackerspace (<a href="http://skillhouse.org/">http://skillhouse.org/</a>).</p>

<p>Some very cool demos are in the lineup, including one by SIT co-founder John Sawyer. He’s going to showcase the awesome wireless tool, rfcat. I’m told he’ll also have some fun hardware with him ^_^</p>

<p>The space is located in the Sun Center Plaza, in the former location of comedy club Wise Guys.</p>
