<p>Hello SITers!</p>

<p>Welcome back to an exciting spring semester. This Wednesday marks the first Student Infosec Team meeting of 2015! It’s a fresh and exciting start as we begin the semester with our new website found at <a href="http://www.ufsit.org">ufsit.org</a>. A big thanks to <a href="https://andrewjkerr.github.io">Andrew Kerr</a>, the leader of the project, for all the hard work he put into making it possible.</p>

<p>At this weeks meeting we will be briefly introducing new members of the club to our online resources like IRC, mailing list, Github, etc. We will then follow this up by watching /chatting about a fantastic presentation given by <a href="https://twitter.com/at1as">atlas</a> during defcon 14 tittled “The Making of atlas: Kiddie to Hacker in 5 Sleepless Nights”</p>

<p>This is really fantastic/inspirational talk that really got me into infosec when I was a freshman. I’m super excited to watch it with you guys. Hope to see you there!</p>

<p>President of SIT, Vincent Moscatello</p>
