<p>There will be no SIT meeting this evening (awww)</p>

<p>My fiancée and I will be out of town this weekend for pre-wedding activities (bridal shower, family cookout, etc.), and we have to leave Gainesville earlier than expected.</p>

<p>We’ll resume our regularly-scheduled meetings next week. See you then!</p>
