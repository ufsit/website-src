<p>Good afternoon, Hackers!</p>

<p>There will be no meeting this evening… because I’m getting married Saturday!
We’ve still got people to see and stuff to do.</p>

<p>Since I will probably forget to send out an e-mail about it… there will be no meeting next week (07-26-2012).
I’ll be at DEF CON in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>See you August 2nd!</p>
