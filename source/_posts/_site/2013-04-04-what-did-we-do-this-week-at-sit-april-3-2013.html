<strong>###Git the REPOsitory collaboration tool.###</strong>
What is Git?
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git<em>%28software%29](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git</em>%28software%29)</p>

<p>The beautiful part:
Its already installed on BackTrack Linux!</p>

<p>If you want to look at the challenges from iCTF, you will have to grab them from GitHub. To do that, clone our repo here: <a href="https://github.com/ufsit/meeting-files.git">https://github.com/ufsit/meeting-files.git</a></p>

<p>Gitting the files:
git clone —- clones the repository
//This is how you get the files onto your desktop.</p>

<p>Updating the repo you are in:
git pull —- “Pulls” down the latest version of the repo from GitHub or wherever
//Did someone make changes to your repo? :O</p>

<p>Putting a file (or files/dirs) up on a repo has three main steps:
git add [filename(s), no brackets] —- “Indexes” the file(s). Use ‘.’ in place of [filename] all of the files in your current working directory, and all sub-directories</p>

<p>git commit —- says what do I want to push?</p>

<p>git push —- pushes the file onto the repo</p>

<p><strong>###vim the text editor###</strong></p>

<p>If you aren’t using this wonderful text editor… why aren’t you? Except for you, Joe. Keep your emacs to yourself ;)</p>

<p>To get started, it is quite important to know there are two primary modes you will be interacting with: “normal”(esc) and “interactive”(i). Interactive mode lets you enter text normally but vim’s real power comes from “normal” mode.</p>

<p>Some short cuts from interactive mode are:
yy —- copy current line
pp —- paste on line below
u —- undo
crtl + r —- redo
Some useful commands “use these in normal mode”:
By the way you must enter the”:” in front of the command that is important and totally not a mistake I might have made when first learning vim.</p>

<p>:q —- quit (this one is important)
:w —- write or “save”
:vsp or :vsplit —- gives you two multiple editing screens yay!
Ctrl-W j —- allows you to cycle through the split screens
Ctrl-W w —- allows you to switch between two split screens</p>

<p><strong>###Basic connections TELNET###</strong></p>

<p>Basic usage is:
telnet [IP ADDRESS, NO BRACKETS] [PORT NUMBER, NO BRACKETS]</p>

<p>For more information:
man telnet
<strong>###A little bit of python###</strong>
There are lots of tutorials online!
http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/
If you have any questions or comments please use the mailing list! You asking questions helps everyone learn!!!</p>

<p>If you are uncomfortable you can of course email me, or any of your officers directly.</p>
