<p>Hi SITers!</p>

<p>This week’s presentation will introduce the science behind hashes such as SHA2/MD5 and how they are commonly used on Linux systems. Additionally, this presentation will introduce the hashmap datastructure and how it is implemented in the C programming language. We will discuss how a poor implementation can result in a vulnerability.</p>

<p>Make sure to bring your laptop with the VMs that we installed at the beginning of the semester! If you did not get a chance to download them, find an officer and we’ll give you them.</p>
