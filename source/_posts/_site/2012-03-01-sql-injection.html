<p>We were on the second floor in one of the E22X rooms.</p>

<p>14 attending. Here are some of them.</p>

<p>We talked about the wordpress blog and it’s existence.</p>

<p>Our fearless leader exhorting about the blogoration.</p>

<p>The subject of the day was SQL Injection, and the presenter was Christian (cvk).</p>

<p>I took some rather limited notes. I had to leave early. Maybe Matt can fill in what else there was. I also took the exact url down, cause that seems like a good idea to me.</p>

<p>PHP is super dumb by default. start at the top and go to the bottom.</p>

<p>MySQL shell</p>

<p>example.org/lolololo.php?product_id=3</p>

<p>MySQL comments ‘ – ‘ not sure if space on front or back is needed, so
did both</p>

<p>Tautology: A statement that is true as it is a restatement of it’s own definition. 1 = 1 is a tautology.</p>

<p>Evaluation of comparison of string to int, converts one to other
before doing comparison, so 5 =’5’ works.</p>

<p>As we need to be able to create arbitrary sized tables, use an unqualified select.
select 1, 2, 3, 4;
this results in a table with 4 columns.</p>

<p>Finally, for our topic after we return from break, we should be covering some binary reversing.</p>
