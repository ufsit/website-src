<p>Hi SITers!</p>

<p>This week, we’ll be familiarizing ourselves with x86 binaries on Linux and provide a starting point for reading/modifying machine code. We’ll also be learning about the hex editor hte and other tools like ndisasm.</p>

<p>You can view the document for this meeting here: <a href="https://ufhack.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/red-mod-0.pdf">RED-MOD-0</a> and the doc that goes with it <a href="http://ufhack.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/red-mod-0-annotated-assembly.pdf">RED-MOD-0-ANNOTATED-ASSEMBLY</a></p>

<p>Make sure to bring your laptop with the VMs from last meeting installed! If you did not get a chance to download them, find an officer and we’ll give you them.</p>

<p>Also, as a quick reminder, you can find the meeting recordings at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/ufsit">https://www.youtube.com/ufsit</a>!</p>
