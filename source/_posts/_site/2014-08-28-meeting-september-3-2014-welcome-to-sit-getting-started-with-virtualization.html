<p>Hello SITers,</p>

<p>Get ready for our first meeting of Fall 2014! This week we will be introducing our officers, club structure, and how to get started with virtualization.</p>

<p>Virtualization technology allows a user to emulate an operating system at the software level abstract from underlying hardware. For us, this means we can run an operating system that uses the linux kernel from our Desktop!</p>

<p>Officers are now providing an awesome series of whitepapers that go along with each presentation. To view the docs for this weeks meeting click the link below:</p>

<p>You will need to bring a laptop with Ethernet access with you!</p>
