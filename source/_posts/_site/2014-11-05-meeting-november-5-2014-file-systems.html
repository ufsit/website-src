<p>Hey SITers!</p>

<p>This week, we will be taking a look at file systems which will include some basic data recovery/forensics as well as basic memory analysis!</p>

<p>Make sure to bring your laptop with the VMs that we installed at the beginning of the semester! If you did not get a chance to download them, find an officer and we’ll give you them.</p>
