<p>Good afternoon, hackers!</p>

<p>I hope y’all had a good Summer… because I sure did. Those of you who went to DEF CON this year know what I’m talking about ^_^
Something about a pool hanging over the side of a $30,000/night Sky Villa and leaving Caesar’s Palace at 6:00am… yea we had fun :-)</p>

<p>Anyway… this evening, we’re going to have some pseudo CTF fun. And, by that I mean we’re going to attack the official DEF CON XX CTF VM.
Mauricio and I will have some sort of shoddy local networking set up and connected to the VM for your hacking pleasure.
Please come prepared with a computer and some flavor of *NIX installed (Local, VM, LiveCD, etc). We’ll provide the CAT5 ;-)</p>

<p>Hope to see y’all in a few hours!
