<p>Hey SITers!</p>

<p>This week, we will be installing Apache on our Ubuntu VM and then talking about HTTP requests and the cool things you can do with them!</p>

<p>Make sure to bring your laptop with the VMs that we installed at the beginning of the semester! If you did not get a chance to download them, find an officer and we’ll give you them.</p>
