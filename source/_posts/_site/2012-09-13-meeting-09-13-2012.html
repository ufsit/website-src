<p>Good afternoon, hackers!</p>

<p>Tonight’s meeting will serve two purposes:

Second, well… this is a hacking team right? As always, there we be plenty of hacking!</p>

- Different types of hacking we can do
- Guest speakers

<p>**On to the hackery…
**We’ll be showing off some of the cool features of this year’s DEF CON badge
… and maybe even demoing a few things we were able to get it do.
Something about Space Invaders… :P</p>

<p>Oh yea… and we have some schweet new (to us) networking hardware to play with!</p>
