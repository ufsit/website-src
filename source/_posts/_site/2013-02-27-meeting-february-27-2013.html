<p>Good evening, SIT’ers!</p>

<p>Tomorrow night, we’re going to discuss yet another CTF topic. This time,
we’re going to show you how to sniff and analyze network traffic!
Capture all the things!</p>

<p>In CTFs like the upcoming UCSB iCTF (March 22nd), which have an
attack/defend network component, it is often (read: always) necessary to
capture and parse traffic going across the wire. Are they hacking us?</p>

<p>You might be thinking to yourself… “so, do I need some fancy FBI
wiretapping device and a signal analyzer to do this?” Fear not! You just
need a couple tools, some eyeballs (maybe), and the willingness to stare
at some packet data :-)</p>

<p>As I’ve said a bazillion times in the past, almost anyone can find
<em>something</em> useful when looking at a packet capture. If you enjoy
defending the castle… this is definitely one of the areas you should
consider.</p>

<p><strong>Shtoof to Bring</strong>
- Laptop running Linux (local install or VM)
- Wireshark (already included in BackTrack)</p>
