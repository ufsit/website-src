<p>Hey SITers!</p>

<p>This week, we will be covering passive and active recon techniques! Recon is a handy skill to have during CTFs and also a valuable skill for pen testers</p>

<p>Also, just a quick reminder that B-Sides Orlando is coming up soon! A few of us have already bought our tickets and are looking forward to it. The call for papers ends on Friday, so there should be a mostly finalized schedule available shortly afterwards.
