<p>Hello SITers!</p>

<p>Our first meeting of the semester will on <em>TUESDAY</em> (yes, Tuesday) at 6pm in CSE E309. We’ll be introducing the club and then learning a bit about SQL injection! While there are computers there, they are limited so we recommend that you bring your own.</p>

<p>Hope to see you there!</p>
