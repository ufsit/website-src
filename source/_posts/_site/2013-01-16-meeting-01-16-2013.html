<p>Welcome back, SIT’ers!  </p>

<p>We hope you had a great holiday and are refreshed for a new semester of fun and hacking. This week will be the first meeting of the semester, and it will be all about introductions!  </p>

<p>First off, we’re going to talk about the Student Infosec Team and hacking in general. And maybe get a feeling of what members want to get out of being a part of SIT, and what they’re interested in learning.  </p>

<p>We will also talk about what we’re going to be doing this semester: CTF competitions! What are CTFs, and what do we need in order to participate and profit. And have fun in the process!  </p>

<p>We will introduce one of our famous members (alias: cvk), who will chat with you about how he got started with hacking, how he got involved with SIT, what he learned while part of the club, and how he got a career in infosec.  </p>

<p>Finally, we want you to get acquainted with two of the best lines of communication with fellow SIT’ers and members of the infosec community: the SIT-L mailing list and our IRC channel. If you do not know what those are, fear not: we will go over how to use them.  </p>

<p>[Time and Location]  </p>

<p>8:00pm-10:00pm  </p>
