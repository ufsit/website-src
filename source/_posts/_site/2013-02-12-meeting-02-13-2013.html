<p>Good morning, SIT’ers!</p>

<p>This week, we’re going to finish up our first lesson on tools, and then get to the challenge from last week.</p>

<p>This time, we shouldn’t have any “issues” with the server.</p>

<p>After the challenge, we’re going to switch gears, and have a discussion on binary reversing (a big part of the current CTF scene). Gabriel is going to teach you about some of the tools needed for reversing, with a short demo… and then we’ll have you go hands-on against a couple challenges. If you’re a little more advanced, fear not… we <em>will</em> have at least one bonus challenge.</p>

<p><strong>Ghost in the Shellcode CTF</strong>
If you missed hearing about this, the GitS CTF is this weekend (Feb 15-17th). UFSIT will be competing in the CTF, under the team name Kernel Sanders.</p>

<p>We will be set up in the 1151 McCarty A conference room, with plenty of CAT5 for local participants. Remote participation will be available, for those who need it. SSH keys will be supplied at this week’s SIT meeting.</p>

<p>Food and drinks will be provided for those participating locally.</p>
