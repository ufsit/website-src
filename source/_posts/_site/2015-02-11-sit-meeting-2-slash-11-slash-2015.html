<p>Hello there SITers! This week we will be taking another look at stack based exploitation. We worked on this last semester, but it’s a good idea to become familiar with this before we move on to harder exploits like format string vulnerabilities and heap based attacks.</p>

<p>Hope to see you there!</p>
