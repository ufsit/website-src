<p>Hey SITers!</p>

<p>This week, we’ll be talking about some of the underlying technologies that allow the Internet to work and explaining how to use Netcat and Wireshark to interact and analyze those technologies.</p>

<p>You can view the document for this meeting here: <a href="http://www.andrewjkerr.com/blue-mod-1.pdf">BLUE-MOD-1</a></p>

<p>Make sure to bring your laptop with the VMs that we installed at the beginning of the semester! If you did not get a chance to download them, find an officer and we’ll give you them.</p>

<p>Also, as a quick reminder, you can find the meeting recordings at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/ufsit">https://www.youtube.com/ufsit</a>!</p>
