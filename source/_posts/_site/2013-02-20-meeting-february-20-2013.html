<p>Good evening, SIT’ers!</p>

<p>We had a great time competing in the Ghost in the Shellcode CTF this weekend. Thanks to those who participated.. we truly couldn’t have done it without you. Feel free to give a brief account of your experience at this week’s meeting :-)</p>

<p>Oh… and all I’m going to say is… have you kissed a girl “before it catches fire”?
Also… this is why we can’t have nice things. </p>

<p>Since we didn’t get to it last week, we’re starting our section on Binary Reversing this week.</p>

<p>Gabriel is going to teach you about some of the tools needed for reversing, with a short demo… and then we’ll have you go hands-on against a couple challenges. If you’re a little more advanced, fear not… we <em>will</em> have at least one bonus challenge.</p>

<p><strong>Things to bring</strong>
- Laptop running Linux (local install or VM)
- IDA Evaluation version (available for Windows/Linux/OSX)
