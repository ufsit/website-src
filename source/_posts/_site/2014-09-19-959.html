<p>Hey SITers!</p>

<p>It’s that time of the semester again when Kernel Sanders competes in the first CTF of the semester! Like I mentioned at the meeting, CSAW is a great CTF for beginners since it’s labeled as “a competition designed for undergraduate students who are trying to break into cyber security”.</p>

<p>And, thanks to <a href="http://www.includesecurity.com">Include Security</a>, we will have pizza to chow down on while we’re having fun hacking all the things.</p>

<p>We’ll be in <strong>CSE E309 starting at 6:30pm on Friday</strong> so come out and hack with us! And, just note that you don’t have to be there for the full 48 hours - feel free to come and go as you wish.</p>
