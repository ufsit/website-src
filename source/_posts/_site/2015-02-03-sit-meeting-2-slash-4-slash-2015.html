<p>Hello SITers!</p>

<p>This week we are going taking a closer look at how processes are organized in memory and learn a bit about DLL injection! The bulk of the presentation will be about a project I did where IDA was used to reverse engineer a malware sample and turn the assembly back and to a C program that can be compiled and run in Visual Studio. If you can’t make it out to the presentation you can read a full writeup of the project here: <a href="http://sheepshellcode.com/blog/2015/02/01/dll-injection-on-windows-xp/">http://sheepshellcode.com/blog/2015/02/01/dll-injection-on-windows-xp/</a></p>

<p>After the presentation, we are going to pick up where we left off and solve a few challenges again. I really want to get rid of that book! Since the third challenge was broken last time expect a slightly harder one to take its place.</p>
