<p>It’s the 4th Wed of the month already and time for SwampSec. Come on out to the Bull for some brew/coffee/wine/etc and wicked security conversations. There’s been a lot going on in the local community in addition to lots of planning for the epic Summer security conferences going on in Las Vegas – Black Hat, BSidesLV, and DefCon 21.</p>
