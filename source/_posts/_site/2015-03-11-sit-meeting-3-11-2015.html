<p>Hello SITers,</p>

<p>Meetings will resume this Wednesday with an awesome presentation/series of challenges by our Vice President Daniel Gollahon! This should be a really fun meeting even if you’re new to reverse engineering since the only prerequisite is knowing a bit of Java.</p>

<p>If you would like to download the challenges ahead of time you can find them at <a href="https://github.com/ufsit/decompiling-3-11-2015">https://github.com/ufsit/decompiling-3-11-2015</a>. The gpg password will be released on the mailing list after the meeting.</p>

<p>Hope to see you there!</p>
