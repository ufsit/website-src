<p>Hello SITers!</p>

<p>If you missed last nights meeting, we announced that we will be participating in the Ghost in the Shellcode CTF! Last year’s CTF was extremely fun and was focused on hacking the Pwn Adventure 2 videogame. We killed a million boars, gave ourselves super speed, and even fought a pack of angry bears with AK47s that, errr, had the right to bear arms. And who could forget the best credits/crypto challenge a game has ever had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHsIWVceQo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtHsIWVceQo</a>?</p>
