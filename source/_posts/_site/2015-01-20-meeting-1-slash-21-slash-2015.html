<p>Hello SITers,</p>

<p>This week we will be taking a closer look at some of the tools described by atlas and getting hands on with some x86 binaries! To encourage everyone to solve them as fast as they can, we will be giving out a signed copy of “Hacking Exposed 7” to the first person to email me all the keys after the challenges are released.</p>

<p>President of SIT, Vincent Moscatello</p>
