<p>Good afternoon, hackers!</p>

<p>Tonight, we will revisit the OWASP Broken Web App VM that we poked at earlier this month.
With this one, we’ll at least have some idea where to begin (it helps having a list of known exploits and hints to pwn them).
This will hopefully be more of a “real world” example than the DEF CON CTF VM we tried last week.</p>

<p>If you’d like to read up on relevant material before the meeting, the OWASP Top 10 is a good place to start:

Oh, and please don’t look for write-ups to solve the challenges… it kind of defeats the purpose of the exercise.</p>

<p>As an added note… this time, we should have everything set up and running before the meeting begins. Sorry for making y’all wait last week.</p>
