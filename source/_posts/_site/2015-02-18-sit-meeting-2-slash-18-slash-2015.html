<p>Hello SITers,</p>

<p>This week we will be learning about how the port scanner nmap works by taking a look at some C code and doing some buffer overflow challenges for another prize! If you would like to download the challenges ahead of time you can find them here: <a href="https://github.com/ufsit/overflowchallenges-2-18-2015">https://github.com/ufsit/overflowchallenges-2-18-2015</a>.</p>

<p>Password for gpg will be released at the meeting.</p>

<p>Hope to see you there!</p>
