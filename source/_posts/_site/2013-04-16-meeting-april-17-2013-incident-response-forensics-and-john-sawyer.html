<p>Good morning SITers!</p>

<p>John Sawyer, a SIT founder &amp; pen tester for InGuardians, will be</p>

<p>speaking on Wed night. We will also be holding officer elections as</p>

<p>well as talking about some upcoming events that SIT will be hosting.</p>

<p>John will be covering the following topics to get everyone prepped for</p>

<p>the upcoming SIT CTF on Saturday, April 20:</p>

<p>” <strong><em>Incident Response and Forensics</em></strong></p>

<p>We will do a quick introduction into the world of incident response</p>

<p>and forensics with a brief overview of what the different stages are,</p>

<p>important tools and techniques, and some hands-on examples. Pay</p>

<p>careful attention because some of these exercises may come in handy</p>

<p>during the SIT CTF.</p>

<p>The example exercises will be available in our GitHub repo so you can</p>

<p>grab them later if you miss the meeting.</p>

<p><strong><em>Cyber Quest April 2013</em></strong></p>

<p>Packet Capture-based Web Vulnerability Analysis</p>

<p><a href="http://uscc.cyberquests.org/">http://uscc.cyberquests.org/</a></p>

<p>We probably won’t cover much about how to do this competition since</p>

<p>Mauricio has already talked about the topic, but I want to discuss it</p>

<p>briefly. It would be awesome to get as many UF participants as we can.</p>
