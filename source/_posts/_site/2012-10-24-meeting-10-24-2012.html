<p>Good morning SIT’ers!</p>

<p>Last week, you got a taste of some pretty basic Recon tactics. We did a
little bit of manual web crawling, domain and IP resolution… and a few
of you found interesting Best Buy locations on farms in Iceland?</p>

<p>Near the end of the meeting, we released a “tool pack” containing the
following tools:
- recon-ng
- pushpin v1 (v2 released this past weekend)
- fierce domain scan
- dnsrecon (blank directory, couldn’t provide due to dead link on dev’s
site)</p>

<p>So… this week, it’s Tool Time™!
We’re going to show you a short demo of the first two tools. Then, we’ll
give you some hands-on time.</p>

<p><strong>Stuff to bring</strong>
You will need a computer for this meeting
- Linux or Linux VM (like Samurai or BackTrack)</p>
