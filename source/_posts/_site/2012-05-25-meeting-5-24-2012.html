<p>This evening’s hacking meeting will be in McCarty A 1151 at 6:00pm.</p>

<p>The next two meetings will center around the upcoming DEF CON CTF Quals.   (mark your calendars for June 1-3)</p>

<p>If you’re planning to participate in the qualifier, you MUST attend next week’s meeting!   (registration ends at 8:00pm next Thursday)</p>

<p>Tonight, I’d like to get as many people registered as possible… and start getting people familiar with the competition.</p>
