<p>At tonight’s meeting, we’ll be discussing the WordPress Security Scanner. Developed by Ryan Dewhurst (ethicalhack3r), this powerful tool can help penetration testers check the security of WordPress installations, using a black box approach. While it’s <em>only</em> targeted at sites running WordPress (who uses WordPress, right? oh wait…), this scanner is no joke.</p>

<p>Come join us for discussion and demos!</p>
