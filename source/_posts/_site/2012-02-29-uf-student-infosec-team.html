<p>Welcome to the University of Florida Student InfoSec Team!</p>

<p>The SIT was created in August of 2006 by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jwiens">Jordan Wiens</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/johnhsawyer">John Sawyer</a>, both part of the UF Security Team at the time. After their team won the <a href="http://defcon.org/">DefCon</a> 14 and 15 Capture the Flag competitions, they were approached by students who wanted to learn more about computer security. Together, they led the group for several years before leaving the university. Today, the group still meets weekly to learn the same concepts that have been taught since the groups inception.</p>
