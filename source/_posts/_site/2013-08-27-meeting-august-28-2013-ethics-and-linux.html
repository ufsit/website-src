<p>Good evening, SIT’ers!</p>

<p>This Wednesday (August 28, 2013) we will be talking about ethics, beginning Linux, and some challenges that Chris has made for us! I’ll send out the challenges later tonight and they will be available for you to solve. If you do solve them, please keep the solution to yourself until Wednesday when we’ll be discussing the challenges. (Update: the challenges are now available at <a href="http://www.hackerhut.net/ufsit/">http://www.hackerhut.net/ufsit/</a>!)</p>
