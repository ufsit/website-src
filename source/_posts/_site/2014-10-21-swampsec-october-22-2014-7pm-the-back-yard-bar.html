<p>Hey SITers!</p>

<p>This week, come join us at The Back Yard Bar (between Boca Fiesta and the Palomino Pool Hall downtown; map: <a href="http://www.swampsec.org/map-web.png">http://www.swampsec.org/map-web.png</a>) for this month’s SwampSec!</p>

<p><strong>Please note that we will NOT be meeting in CSE309.</strong></p>

<p>If you don’t know what SwampSec is, it’s a gathering of infosec professionals and enthusiasts that takes place from 7 to roughly 9pm on the fourth Wednesday of the month. For more information, check out <a href="http://swampsec.org/">http://swampsec.org/</a> and follow SwampSec on Twitter @swampsec. Hope to see you there!</p>
