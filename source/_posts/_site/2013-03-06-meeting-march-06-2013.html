<p>Good evening, SIT’ers!</p>

<p>Tonight’s meeting will be very informal.
Discussion will center around the upcoming UCSB iCTF (March 22nd).</p>

<p>I will not be able to attend on-site, due to a nasty head cold I’ve been
battling since Friday. I <em>might</em> be able to participate via Google Hangout.</p>

<p>Mauricio will take over running things tonight.</p>
