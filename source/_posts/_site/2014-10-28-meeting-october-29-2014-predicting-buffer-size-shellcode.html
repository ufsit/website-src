<p>Hey SITers!</p>

<p>This week, we will be familiarizing members with predicting the size of buffers that may have been optimized by using pattern_create.rb and pattern_offset.rb. We’ll also be introducing the concept of shellcode along with msfvenom - a useful tool that is part of the metasploit framework.</p>

<p>Make sure to bring your laptop with the VMs that we installed at the beginning of the semester! If you did not get a chance to download them, find an officer and we’ll give you them.</p>
