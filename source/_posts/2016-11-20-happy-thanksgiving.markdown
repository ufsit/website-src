Hey SIT!

Thanks to everyone who came out to the Metasploitable meeting this week. It was a cool introduction to everyone's favorite hacking assistance tool, Metasploit. I highly encourage everyone to explore and exploit the Metasploitable VM on their own time, it's great practice! You'll be working on a different set of skills than required in CTF challenges; its important to be a well-rounded hacker.

In other news, thanks to everyone who participated in the RC3 CTF this weekend! As of right now, we are placed 101 out of 646 participating teams. The CTF ends at 12pm Sunday, so maybe we can solve one more challenge for top 100! Congratulations to everyone who solved a challenge and learned a thing or two =)

There will not be a meeting this week due to Thanksgiving. Hope everyone has safe travels home and enjoys a nice break from school, full of food and family time!

See ya in a few weeks!
