Think Mr. Robot has some unbelievable hacking scenarios? Think again.

Our great and legendary club founder, John Sawyer, will be coming to visit us this Thursday to regale us with tales of the wild, wild computer world! John Sawyer holds two DEFCON CTF 1st place standings; once in 2014, and a repeat win in 2015. For those of you who don't know, DEFCON is the most competitive and widely known CTF event in the world - winning even once is a huge deal. Needless to say, he has plenty of interesting hacking stories to share with us!

Come on out to see how far the rabbit hole really goes.
