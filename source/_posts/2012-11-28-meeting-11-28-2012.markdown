Good morning, SIT'ers!

Tonight's meeting is going to be all about CTFs.

We'll go over some of the challenges and happenings from PoliCTF (Nov 17), then we'll dive right in to our prep for rwthCTF (Nov 30 ... yea, that's this Friday!).

Please bring a laptop, and look over the rwthCTF website ([http://ctf.itsec.rwth-aachen.de/](http://ctf.itsec.rwth-aachen.de/)) prior to the meeting to get an idea of how the game is set up.
