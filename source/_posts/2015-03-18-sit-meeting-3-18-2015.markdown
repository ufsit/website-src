Hello SITers!

This week we will be getting some insight into the world of malware by watching a DEFCON 18 talk titled: My Life as a Spyware Developer. This will be followed up by a discussion about ethics. We will also talk a bit more about officer positions and how to run. It was announced at the last meeting that elections will happen April 1st!

Hope to see you there!
