Hey SITers!







This week, we will be taking a look at file systems which will include some basic data recovery/forensics as well as basic memory analysis!







Make sure to bring your laptop with the VMs that we installed at the beginning of the semester! If you did not get a chance to download them, find an officer and we'll give you them.
