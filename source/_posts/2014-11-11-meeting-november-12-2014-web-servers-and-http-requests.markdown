Hey SITers!







This week, we will be installing Apache on our Ubuntu VM and then talking about HTTP requests and the cool things you can do with them!







Make sure to bring your laptop with the VMs that we installed at the beginning of the semester! If you did not get a chance to download them, find an officer and we'll give you them.
