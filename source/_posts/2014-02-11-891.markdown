Hey SITers!







This week, we'll be going over how to crack ssh passwords with Hydra! Hydra is a very powerful password cracker that allows for dictionary attacks against popular services (in this case the ssh service we covered last week.)







Also, as a heads up, next week we will have John Sawyer from InGuardians (and the founder of UFSIT) coming to our meeting to give a presentation on pen testing so be sure to mark next week's meeting on your calendars!
