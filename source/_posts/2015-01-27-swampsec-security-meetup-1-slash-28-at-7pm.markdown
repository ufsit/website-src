Hello SIT members. It's time again for SwampSec. The general announcement is below but in addition to it, I'll have a small tab setup for drinks if you're into that sort of thing. Hope to see you Wed.

##########
We're picking back up after a long break caused by the holidays. There's been lots going on in the infosec world and it seems like everyone is hiring... including my employer (InGuardians). Come on out for an hour or two to hang out and talk all things security.

Since Stubbies closed, we've only had one meetup at the The Back Yard Bar and it worked out well with the available food/drink options from the bar and Boca Fiesta (but we're still open to other suggestions). If you don't know where it is, The Back Yard Bar is located between Boca Fiesta and the Palomino Pool Hall next to the Hippodrome.

Where: [The Back Yard Bar](http://www.bocafiesta.com/)
When: 7pm 1/28
