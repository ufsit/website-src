Hello SITers,

Meetings will resume this Wednesday with an awesome presentation/series of challenges by our Vice President Daniel Gollahon! This should be a really fun meeting even if you're new to reverse engineering since the only prerequisite is knowing a bit of Java.

If you would like to download the challenges ahead of time you can find them at [https://github.com/ufsit/decompiling-3-11-2015](https://github.com/ufsit/decompiling-3-11-2015). The gpg password will be released on the mailing list after the meeting.

Hope to see you there!
