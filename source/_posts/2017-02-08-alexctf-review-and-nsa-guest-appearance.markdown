Hey SIT!

Following our great success at the AlexCTF Capture-the-flag event last friday, several students will be presenting their CTF challenge writeups! This involves explaining the challenge and working through the solution. If you were stuck on any challenge (like 99% of the rest of us), come on out to learn how it's done!

Afterwards, an NSA representative will be here to give us a special look into the mysterious entity that is the National Security Agency. This is an excellent opportunity to learn how information security is applied in the real-world, especially by the government!
