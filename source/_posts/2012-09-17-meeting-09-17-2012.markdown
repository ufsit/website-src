Good morning, hackers!

At tonight's meeting, we've got a bit of a show for you!

Remember how we talked about Web Exploits and Binary Reversing at the last meeting?
Well, this time... we're going to /show/ you how it's done! That's right, you're going to get a live demo of each of them. We'll also go over some of the tools and techniques you can use to accomplish the hacks.

Also... If anyone is available 10-15 minutes prior to the meeting, we could use some help setting up in the conference room. Please let me know via e-mail if you'd be interested in helping out.

**Location and time**:
6:00pm - 8:00pm
1151 McCarty Hall A
