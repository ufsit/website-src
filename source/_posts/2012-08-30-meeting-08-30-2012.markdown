Good afternoon, hackers!

Tonight, we will revisit the OWASP Broken Web App VM that we poked at earlier this month.
With this one, we’ll at least have some idea where to begin (it helps having a list of known exploits and hints to pwn them).
This will hopefully be more of a “real world” example than the DEF CON CTF VM we tried last week.

If you’d like to read up on relevant material before the meeting, the OWASP Top 10 is a good place to start:
[http://owasptop10.googlecode.com/files/OWASP%20Top%2010%20-%202010.pdf](http://owasptop10.googlecode.com/files/OWASP%20Top%2010%20-%202010.pdf)
Oh, and please don’t look for write-ups to solve the challenges... it kind of defeats the purpose of the exercise.

As an added note… this time, we should have everything set up and running before the meeting begins. Sorry for making y’all wait last week.
