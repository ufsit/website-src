    About Section
 ##################-->
<p>The University of Florida Student Infosec Team (UFSIT) was founded in the Fall of 2006 by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jwiens">Jordan Wiens</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/johnhsawyer">John Sawyer</a> shortly after their team’s (1@stplace) first win at the DefCon 14 Capture the Flag (CTF) competition. Several students approached Jordan and John to learn more about security and that interest led to the formation of the SIT.</p>

<p>The goals for the SIT are simple – to provide an environment for students (and anyone else who’s interested and willing to participate) to learn more about information security topics such as penetration testing, reverse engineering, exploit development, etc. The SIT holds weekly meetings that are student led and regularly include presentations from local IT professionals and guest industry speakers. In addition to meetings, the SIT regularly participates in CTF events and hosts their own to help members sharpen their skills.</p>

<p>Over the years, the SIT has enjoyed a varied membership of students, UF employees, and local IT professionals, many of whom have gone off to work in a wide array of different areas within the IT industry including reverse engineering, exploit development, penetration testing, incident response, digital forensics, risk assessment, and more.</p>

        <i>Faculty Sponsor</i>
        <p>Dr. Joseph N. Wilson is the faculty advisor for the UF Student Infosec Team. He has been a faculty member at the University of Florida since 1984-1/2. His interest in Information Security was (re)kindled when Jim Hranicky complained that UF students were being not being properly educated in secure software development. After having taught a Secure Programming course a couple of times, in 2012 he decided to dig deeper into the security arena and sought education outside the university. From sources such as SANS (he now holds GIAC GPEN, GXPN, and GWAPT certifications) and hacker cons, he has sought to learn what he can from the people who know what they know. One of the now-dying breed of people with three-letter usernames, you can contact him via email at <a href="mailto:jnw@cise.ufl.edu">jnw@cise.ufl.edu</a> and consult <a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~jnw">https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~jnw</a> for more information.
